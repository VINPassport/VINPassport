# Architecture

The legal basis for everything below is
**[Regulation (EU) 2026/1738](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2026/1738/oj)**, Article 13 — see
[REGULATION.md](REGULATION.md) for primary sources and the scope boundaries that constrain what we
may claim.

## Shape

The target: VINPassport is a **SAP CAP application** that installs `@odatano/nightgate` as a plugin.
NIGHTGATE supplies the chain integration; VINPassport supplies the vehicle domain and the user-facing
surfaces.

We do **not** fork NIGHTGATE. Where a need is general rather than vehicle-specific, it goes upstream
as a request or a PR.

## What we get, and what we must build

NIGHTGATE ships the `attestation-vault` contract **precompiled**, and an earlier revision of this
document recorded "no Compact toolchain required" as a benefit of that. **[D16](DECISIONS.md#settled)
reversed it.** The passport's distinguishing logic is ours and lives in
[`contracts/vinpassport`](../contracts/vinpassport), so Compact is on the critical
path. Compiled artifacts are committed, so only contributors *changing* the contract need the
toolchain — but they need WSL2, macOS or Linux, because Compact has no native Windows binary.

**Provided by NIGHTGATE (Wave 2 onward — see [D20](DECISIONS.md#settled)):** document anchoring,
salted-Merkle field proofs, six predicate kinds,
three-level on-chain disclosure grants, async job orchestration, wallet and proving infrastructure,
OData V4 query semantics over all of it, and transaction fee sponsoring.

**Ours to build:** the passport contract itself, the vehicle domain model, the provable-field
registry, tier redaction rules and their query guard, both UIs, document storage, the auth strategy,
and all HTTP security middleware. NIGHTGATE deliberately installs no global middleware — CORS, CSP
and HSTS are the host's problem.

## Disclosure tiers

NIGHTGATE's three levels map onto vehicle stakeholders cleanly:

| Level | Tier | Audience | Sees |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `public` | Buyer scanning a listing | Make, model, year, category, type approval, environmental declarations |
| 1 | `trade` | Dealer, recycler, insurer, lender | + write-off category, accident count, owner count, service count, mileage |
| 2 | `authority` | DMV, police, notified body, ELV facility | + VIN, supplier identities, full lineage, dismantling data |

Two enforcement layers, and the second is not optional. Redaction after a database read is
**bypassable via `$filter`, `$orderby` and `$apply`** — an attacker who cannot *see* a column can
still binary-search its value by filtering on it. So the service must also reject queries that
*probe* an invisible column, not merely strip it from the response. NIGHTPASS learned this; we
inherit the lesson rather than rediscovering it.

On-chain grants can **elevate** a caller above their login role for a specific passport. Grantee
identities are `sha256(did)` — a pseudonym, never PII.

## Predicates worth demonstrating

| Claim | Mechanism | Why it lands |
|---|---|---|
| Never written off | `proveFieldAtMost` — `writeOffCategory ≤ 0` | The costliest lie in the used market, and the one a buyer cannot check today |
| Never had a reported accident | `proveFieldAtMost` — `accidentCount ≤ 0` | A clean-history claim that discloses nothing about incidents |
| One keeper from new | `proveFieldAtMost` — `ownerCount ≤ 1` | Provenance, without naming anybody |
| Mileage has never decreased | `recordField` under `neverFalls` | The fraud everyone recognises, proven without revealing a reading |
| Nothing changed but the service fields | `documentComparison` across anchor versions | The general detector: catches the frauds nobody thought to ask about — **Wave 2: needs ≥2 anchored roots per vehicle; the Wave 1 `vinpassport` contract stores one immutable `contentRoot`, so this predicate is not buildable on it yet** |
| Recycled content meets threshold | `proveFieldAtMost` / `AtLeast` on slots 8–11 | Compliance proof that does not leak supplier economics |

**Build the write-off and accident claims first.** They are one circuit call each, they are what a
buyer actually asks, and they demonstrate the whole mechanism — a claim answered against an anchored
record with nothing disclosed. The mileage case is the same machinery on a field people already have
intuitions about, which makes it the better *explanation* but not the better first build.

A false claim **aborts during local proving, before submission** — it never reaches the chain. A
successful transaction *is* the proof.

A successful proof also **records the claim**: which vehicle, which field, which direction, which
bound, and the commitment it was proven against. That is what gives a verifier something to read
afterwards rather than requiring them to be handed a transaction hash — see
[D19](DECISIONS.md#settled). The claim names its field, deliberately; it never carries the value.
Binding it to the commitment is what stops a claim outliving the value it was made about.

## The trust gap

**This is the most important section in this document, and the easiest to gloss over.**

NIGHTGATE's own architecture notes state the limit plainly: a fully trustless binding between the
anchored content root and the payload hash would need in-circuit blake2b, which is impractical. The
same attester builds both from the same content at anchor time.

So:

> **The producer is trusted to input truthful values.** A ZK proof shows a value *opens the
> commitment previously recorded for that vehicle and field* and satisfies a bound. Two things it
> does **not** show. First, nothing about whether that value matches physical reality. Second — and
> this is a property of the contract, not of physics — the per-field commitments and the anchored
> `contentRoot` are written by independent circuit calls, and no circuit cross-checks them; so a
> proof binds a value to its field commitment, not to the anchored document. Consistency between the
> two is the producer's responsibility in Wave 1, not a property the contract enforces (see
> [D23](DECISIONS.md#settled)).

For batteries this is tolerable — a manufacturer declaring its own carbon footprint is the assumed
model, and the regulation is built around accountable self-declaration.

**For self-declared history and VIN integrity it is the entire problem.** A garage that anchors a
false accident count, or a rolled-back reading, produces proofs that are cryptographically perfect
and factually false. Anchoring
makes the lie *immutable and attributable*; it does not make it detectable.

Three honest responses, and we intend all three:

1. **Attribute every anchor.** Tamper-evidence and a named attester is a real improvement on a paper
   service book, even without hardware. Fraud becomes traceable rather than deniable.
2. **Prove consistency, not truth.** Monotonicity across versions catches the common rollback case
   without any trust assumption, because it compares the producer's own prior commitments.
3. **Close the gap at the writer, not the sensor.** A proof inherits the trust of whoever wrote the
   value, so the gap closes when the value is committed by a party already accountable for it —
   registries, testers, insurers writing under an accountable identity, with marking that lets a
   verifier tell such a write from a self-declared one. That is a data-relationship problem before
   it is a cryptographic one, and it is precisely the gap NIGHTGATE documents and does not attempt
   to fill. **Attestation at the sensor would also close it, but on-device hardware is out of scope
   with no timeline and must not be presented as a dated phase** — see the scope notice below.

Nothing shipped should be described as preventing fraud. It makes fraud attributable and rollbacks
detectable. That is a real claim; the stronger one would be false.

> **Scope notice, 9 September 2026.** On-device chip proving is **out of scope with no timeline**.
> It is not a phase, not a milestone, and must not appear as one — here, in the roadmap, in the
> deck, or in a conversation. This supersedes the hardware half of **D6** and the hardware items in
> `ROADMAP.md`, both of which predate it and have not yet been formally reversed.

## Hard constraints

| Constraint | Consequence |
|---|---|
| **No in-circuit signature verification on mainnet.** Compact 0.31.x / ledger 8 has none. `jubjubSchnorrVerify` exists only on the ledger-9 RC line (0.33+), undocumented and deployed nowhere public. | Phase 2 sensor signatures cannot be verified in-circuit today. Spec the hardware **curve-agile** — Ed25519 is *not* a safe default; Schnorr-over-Jubjub is the likely landing point. |
| **NIGHTGATE hard-gates mainnet off** (`allowMainnetSubmission: false`). | Preprod is the target. Plan no mainnet demo. |
| **32 provable slots** via `attestation-vault-32` (NIGHTGATE 0.19.0). Width is effectively permanent — cross-root proofs relate same-width documents only. | 26 in use, 6 reserved. See [FIELDS.md](FIELDS.md). No longer the binding constraint, but the width choice is one-way. |
| **Sponsor throughput scales with wallet count**, not balance — one dust spend in flight per wallet. | Treasury is a pool. See [BUILD-SCOPE.md](BUILD-SCOPE.md). |
| **`setNetworkId()` is process-global.** | One network per process. No multi-network single deployment. |
| **NIGHTGATE is 0.x, shipping breaking changes roughly weekly.** A whole attestation lane was removed at 0.16.0; salting at 0.16.0 broke every older client. | **Pin exact versions.** Never use `^` on `@odatano/*`. Upgrade deliberately, with a re-anchor plan. |
| **Bus factor of one** across the entire ODATANO org. | Apache-2.0 makes a fork legally trivial. Keep a vendored copy of the exact version in use, and do not accrete dependencies on unreleased behaviour. |
| **Losing `contentSaltSeed` makes an anchored root permanently unprovable.** | Seed backup is an operational requirement with a tested restore path, not a nicety. |

## Verification status

This document is derived from reading public ODATANO repositories and Midnight release notes. It has
**not** been validated by running the stack. Before building on any specific claim here, confirm it
against the installed packages — the checklist in [FIELDS.md](FIELDS.md) is the starting point.
