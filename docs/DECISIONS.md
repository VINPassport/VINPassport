# Decisions

Settled choices and the reasoning behind them. If something here looks wrong, the reasoning is
written down precisely so it can be argued with — but bring an argument, not a preference.

Dates are when the decision was taken.

## Settled

### D1 — Build on NIGHTGATE; do not fork it · 2026-08-21
VINPassport is a consumer application of `@odatano/nightgate`, in the same relation to it as NIGHTPASS.
General needs go upstream as requests or PRs; vehicle-specific work stays here.

**Why:** NIGHTGATE already solves anchoring, ZK predicates, disclosure grants and wallet
infrastructure, with ~89% test coverage and a real release cadence. Rebuilding it would cost months
and produce something worse. Apache-2.0 means forking stays available if the relationship changes.

### D2 — Midnight, not Cardano · locked pre-2026-04, reaffirmed 2026-08-21
Privacy is the product, and Midnight's ZK model is the reason the disclosure tiers mean anything.

**Note:** ODATANO's centre of gravity is Cardano; NIGHTGATE is its Midnight arm. A DAYPASS-style
Cardano twin is a plausible *later* addition — the two share a frozen core so a dual-chain credential
is a known path — but it is not in scope and must not dilute Phase 0.

### D3 — Framed as Regulation (EU) 2026/1738 compliance infrastructure · 2026-08-21
The Digital Circularity Vehicle Passport (Article 13 of
**[Regulation (EU) 2026/1738](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2026/1738/oj)**) is mandatory from
1 Sep 2032; the regulation entered into force 13 Aug 2026 and applies from 1 Sep 2028. Full
citations and primary sources: [REGULATION.md](REGULATION.md).

**Why:** it converts VINPassport from a product nobody is obliged to buy into an implementation of an
obligation everyone in scope must meet. It also resolves a real structural problem in the earlier
positioning, where the paying customer (OEMs) was not the customer whose pain justified the product
(used-car buyers). Compliance collapses that gap.

**Do not overclaim.** [ESPR (Reg 2024/1781)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1781/oj)
explicitly *excludes* vehicles at Article 1(2); the
[battery regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1542/oj) reaches the battery, not the
vehicle. 2026/1738 is the correct and only citation for a vehicle-level passport obligation — see
[REGULATION.md](REGULATION.md).

### D4 — No patent. Apache-2.0, fully open source · 2026-08-21
The patent track is dropped. No CIPC filing, no UK IPO filing.

**Why:** the novelty position became uncertain in absolute-novelty jurisdictions, and resolving that
uncertainty would have cost more than the protection was worth at this stage. Open-source also
matches the ODATANO stack and satisfies Catalyst's licensing requirement.

**Consequence:** the hardware attestation layer is defended by execution and partnership, not by IP.
The local patent drafts remain local — dropping the track is not a reason to publish claim language.

### D5 — Clients never need a crypto wallet; fees are fiat · locked 2026-04-02
No client of any kind is asked to hold NIGHT, DUST, or a wallet.

**Why:** blockchain complexity is an implementation detail, not something to push onto a dealer.
Previously a hand-wave; NIGHTGATE's **fee sponsoring** makes it a real mechanism — a caller with no
funds has their transaction paid for without the sponsor ever seeing a key, witness or preimage.

### D6 — Chip-free; no hardware root of trust · 2026-08-21, amended 2026-09-09
Document anchoring only. No secure element, no sensor signature, no on-device proving.

> **Amended 2026-09-09 by [R5](#reversed): the "hardware is Phase 2" half no longer holds.** This
> decision originally read *"Chip-free through Phase 1; hardware is Phase 2"* and closed with
> *"the chips return in Phase 2 to close the trust gap."* They do not return on any schedule. What
> survives is the whole of the decision now rather than a phase of it: chip-free, full stop.

**Why:** it removes the OEM dependency that previously blocked everything, making the product
demonstrable now instead of after a manufacturer partnership.

**And the trust gap it left open closes elsewhere.** A proof inherits the trust of whoever wrote the
value, so the gap closes at the **writer** — an accountable source committing the value — not at a
sensor. That is the line in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md), and it is still the thing NIGHTGATE
documents and does not attempt to fill.

### D7 — Independent dealers are the beachhead · 2026-06-04 — **REVERSED**, see [R6](#reversed)
Kept as a numbered stub so D7 is not reused. The decision, its reasoning and its reversal are
recorded in full at [R6](#reversed).

### D8 — One repository · 2026-08-21
A single `vinpassport` repo, not the eight-repo split of the previous build.

**Why:** the seven-portal split was a significant part of why v1 stalled — cross-repo dependency
management consumed effort that should have gone into the product. Split later only when something
genuinely needs to ship on its own cadence.

### D9 — Preprod is the deployment target · 2026-08-21
Not mainnet. NIGHTGATE hard-gates mainnet submission off pending an unresolved node issue.

### D10 — Pin exact `@odatano/*` versions · 2026-08-21
Never a `^` or `~` range on any ODATANO package.

**Why:** 0.x with roughly weekly breaking changes. A whole attestation lane was removed at 0.16.0;
leaf salting at the same version broke every older client. Also keep a vendored copy of the exact
version in use — the org has a bus factor of one.

### D11 — Plain HTML/CSS/JS for every UI surface, console included · 2026-08-22
No SAPUI5, no React, no build-step framework for application UI.

**Why:** the product constraint is that this be simple enough for anyone — a used-car buyer with a
phone, a two-person independent dealer. NIGHTPASS uses SAPUI5 for operator apps and plain HTML for
public ones; we go plain throughout, because our operator *is* a small dealer rather than an SAP
shop. Also avoids a framework learning curve on a small team.

### D12 — Custodial per-organisation wallets, built to accept external signers · 2026-08-22
VINPassport custodies one wallet session per organisation. `srv/lib/sponsor.ts` puts the signing source
behind an interface so self-custody drops in later without a rewrite.

**Why:** attribution is the entire value of Phases 0–1. If VINPassport signed everything, VINPassport
would be asserting facts it cannot verify — transferring liability in exactly the wrong direction.
Per-organisation wallets keep the dealer's name on the record while never showing them a key.

**Claim honestly:** custodial attestation is tamper-evident and attributable, **not** non-repudiable.
Pair every attestation with an authenticated intent record. See [BUILD-SCOPE.md](BUILD-SCOPE.md).

### D13 — Every transaction sponsored from a VINPassport treasury pool · 2026-08-22, amended 2026-08-23
No customer ever holds DUST or NIGHT. A **pool** of treasury sponsor sessions pays all fees.

**Amendment (2026-08-23):** this originally said "a designated treasury session", singular. That was
wrong. Since NIGHTGATE 0.17.2 `NIGHTGATE_FEE_SPONSOR_SESSION` is a lease pool, because *"a dust
wallet carries ONE spend in flight, so sponsoring throughput scales with the NUMBER of sponsor
wallets."* Peak concurrent anchoring is bounded by wallet count, each needing its own registered
NIGHT UTxO. **Treasury sizing is a count of wallets, not a balance.**

**Consequence:** we pay per transaction, so per-organisation rate limiting is a cost control, not
just an abuse control. Treasury NIGHT is free on preprod and a real operating cost on mainnet.
Batching (up to 8 calls per transaction, one fee) is the primary lever on that cost.

### D15 — Target `attestation-vault-32`: 32 slots, depth 5 · 2026-08-23
The vehicle document family uses the 32-slot vault lineage introduced in NIGHTGATE 0.19.0, with 26
fields in use and 6 reserved.

**Why:** cross-root proofs relate documents of the same width only, so *"a document family picks a
width and keeps it."* With nothing yet anchored the choice is free; after launch it is a migration
onto a different contract lineage. The previous 16-slot panel was full on day one with twelve
credible fields cut, several plausibly mandatory once 2026/1738 applies in 2028.

**Costs accepted:** the lineage is new (shipped 2026-08-22), prover keys scale linearly so proving is
heavier, and the keys need a separate `npx nightgate-fetch-keys attestation-vault-32` step because
they are not packed into npm. Width 32 versus 16 proving cost is measured in Phase 0.

**Ordering constraint:** reserved slots are typed by position — four numeric before the strings, two
string after — because numerics must precede all strings and reordering changes every root.

### D14 — All payments fiat; billing gates the action, not the chain · 2026-08-22
One-off, subscription or annual, in fiat. No crypto payment path. Entitlement is checked in `srv/`
before NIGHTGATE is called; the contract never learns an invoice exists.

**Deferred:** no billing in Phase 0 and no provider chosen. Plans cannot be priced until DUST cost
per anchor and per proof is measured — which is why that measurement is a Phase 0 task.

### D16 — VINPassport writes its own Compact contract; NIGHTGATE deploys and calls it · 2026-08-23
The vehicle passport logic lives in a VINPassport Compact contract with genuine private-state
management. NIGHTGATE registers it via `cds.requires.nightgate.contracts.<ref>` and supplies
deployment, invocation and fee sponsoring.

**Why:** the earlier plan leaned entirely on NIGHTGATE's precompiled `attestation-vault-32`, and
"no Compact toolchain required" was recorded as a benefit. That is the wrong shape for this project.
The passport's distinguishing logic — readings held as witnesses, monotonicity proven in-circuit,
values never disclosed — is ours, and it belongs in a contract we wrote and can reason about.

**Consequence:** Compact is now on the critical path. It has no native Windows binary, and on this
host `compact` resolves to the Windows NTFS utility — **always compile in WSL2**. Toolchain verified
2026-08-23: CLI 0.5.2, compiler 0.31.1 (language 0.23, ledger 8), smoke compile passing.

**Attribution:** VINPassport is a consumer application built *on* NIGHTGATE, in the same relation
[NIGHTPASS](https://github.com/ODATANO/NIGHTPASS) is. That dependency is stated plainly in the
README rather than left to be discovered.

### D17 — vitest for contract tests, `node --test` for the app layer · 2026-08-25
Two test runners in one repository, split by what they test. Contract tests run on **vitest**;
application unit tests, when they exist, run on **`node --test` + `tsx`**.

**Why:** D-era BUILD-SCOPE recorded `node --test` "deliberately not vitest", to match ODATANO. That
reasoning still holds for the CAP service layer, which is where we integrate most closely with their
tooling and where a contributor moving between the two codebases should find the same conventions.

It does not hold for contract tests. Those exercise compiled Compact circuits through
`@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime`, which is a Midnight concern rather than a CAP one, and Midnight's
own ecosystem tests contracts with vitest — `example-bboard` does, and the `midnight-cq` tooling
assumes it. A reviewer reading our contract tests is a Midnight reviewer, and they should find the
shape they expect.

**Cost, stated plainly:** two runners in one repo is worse than one, and `npm test` has to chain
them. That is accepted in exchange for each half matching the convention of the ecosystem it belongs
to.

**Also pinned here:** `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime` at **exactly 0.16.0**, because it must equal
the `runtime-version` the compiler stamps into `contract-info.json`. A caret range would allow a
silent mismatch between the runtime the tests use and the one the contract was built for.

### D18 — One field-generic contract; the integrity rule lives on the ledger · 2026-08-26
`vinpassport` no longer has odometer-specific circuits. It holds a commitment per
`(vehicle, field)` slot, and `initialiseField` fixes that field's **integrity rule** at creation:
`neverFalls` or `neverRises`.

**Why generic:** a passport is 32 fields. Four odometer circuits plus four near-identical write-off
circuits plus four for accidents is not a design, it is copy-paste — and it would have made the
contract the weakest thing in the repository rather than the strongest.

**Why the rule is stored rather than passed:** if the rule were a call argument, a caller would
simply pass the one that suits them. On the ledger and written once, it cannot be renegotiated, and
recreating a field to change it is refused.

**Why two directions when the panel only uses one:** every field the panel carries today may never
fall — mileage, accidents, keepers, services, write-off category. A rule that could only ever point
one way would not be a rule: `initialiseField` would not need the argument and nothing would be
fixed at creation. Keeping both directions means a field that only declines can be added as a data
change rather than a contract change, and the tests prove that support is real rather than
aspirational.

**Consequence:** `proveFieldAtMost` with a bound of zero expresses "never written off" and "never
had a reported accident"; the odometer is simply field `odometerKm` under `neverFalls`, one field
among the panel rather than the subject of the contract. Both guards mutation-checked: removing
either fails exactly the tests it exists for and nothing else.

**Scope note:** this is the VEHICLE's record. An EV's battery is a separate regime with its own
passport, and [NIGHTPASS](https://github.com/ODATANO/NIGHTPASS) covers that ground. The panel
carries a reference to a battery passport and does not restate its claims — see the open question on
slot 17 in [FIELDS.md](FIELDS.md).

**Also fixed here:** `.gitignore` excluded prover keys with `managed/**/keys/`, which contains a
slash and so anchors to the repository root — it never matched the real path under `contracts/`.
14 MB of keys were one `git add -A` away from being committed. Now `**/managed/**/keys/`.

---

### D19 — A proven claim is recorded on the ledger; the value behind it is not · 2026-08-27

`proveFieldAtMost` and `proveFieldAtLeast` write a `Claim` to a `claims` ledger on success. The
claim carries the slot, the VIN hash, the field key, the bound, the direction, and the commitment
the proof opened. It never carries the value.

**Why:** as first written, both circuits only asserted and returned `[]`. The transaction's success
was the proof — but nothing on the ledger recorded it, so nothing indexed a proof by vehicle. A
scan-to-verdict page had no state to read and could only report that a passport exists. The
alternatives were verification by transaction hash (which needs the hashes handed to the verifier,
or a crawl of every transaction to the contract) and shipping only what the ledger already held
(which is not a verdict). Recording the claim makes the answer an O(1) read.

**Why the commitment is part of the claim:** a claim recorded permanently would otherwise become a
lie. Prove "at most 300 000 km", then record 310 000 — the old claim still sits on the ledger.
Binding the claim to the commitment it was proven against means a verifier comparing it with the
current `fieldCommitment` for the same slot sees a superseded claim for what it is, without being
told. The claim key includes the commitment too, so re-proving after an update writes a new claim
rather than overwriting the old one.

**What this discloses, deliberately:** the field key. Before this, only `slot = hash(domain, vinHash,
fieldKey)` was public, so an observer could not tell the odometer's slot from the write-off
category's. A claim names its field, because a verdict a verifier cannot read is not a verdict.
Fields nobody has claimed about stay unnamed. The VIN hash was already public — `passports` is
keyed by it. **The value remains private in every case**, and the test suite pins both halves: one
test asserts the field is published, the next asserts the reading is not.

**Why the claim carries `slot` and not just the hashes to derive it:** the scan page is plain
HTML/CSS/JS with no build step ([D11](#settled)), so it cannot run `persistentHash` to compute a
claim key or a slot. Everything it needs to render a verdict — and to check the claim is current
— has to be readable straight off the claim. That is a real constraint on the struct's shape, not
redundancy.

**Cost:** one map insert per proof. Enumerating `claims` to answer "what has this vehicle proven?"
is linear, which is fine at demo scale and is the thing to revisit when it is not — an off-chain
index, or key derivation once the page can run `compact-runtime`.

**Mutation-checked.** Removing the claim write from `proveFieldAtMost` fails 9 tests and no others;
pointing `proveFieldAtLeast` at the `atMost` domain tag fails exactly the one test that separates a
ceiling from a floor.

### D20 — `@odatano/nightgate-tx` with sponsored fees; no CAP for Wave 1 · 2026-08-27

> **Amended 2026-08-31 by [D24](#settled): the sponsored-fee half no longer holds.** We fund and
> submit our own transactions now. The library half — `nightgate-tx` for building, batching and
> proving — is unchanged and still on every run. Read the attribution paragraph below as history:
> it was accurate when written, and D24 carries the current wording.

VINPassport deploys and calls `vinpassport` through **`@odatano/nightgate-tx` 0.4.0**, with
ODATANO's hosted NIGHTGATE sponsoring the preprod fees. No SAP CAP application, no Postgres, no
proof server, and no wallet of our own to fund. [D16](#settled) is **deferred, not reversed**.

**Corrected 2026-08-27, same day.** This decision was first recorded on the premise that using
NIGHTGATE meant standing up SAP CAP, because `@odatano/nightgate` declares
`peerDependencies: { '@sap/cds': '>=10 <11' }`. That is the *CAP plugin*. There is a second package,
`@odatano/nightgate-tx`, described as *"drive a hosted NIGHTGATE and build transactions locally with
your own key"* — no CAP, no database, wasm proving in process. Our own `nightgate-demo` clone
already depended on it. The original plan (midnight-js plus a faucet-funded wallet) was more work
than this for a weaker result, and is kept only as the fallback below.

**Why:** Wave 1 was believed to close 2 September 2026 when this was written — the Buildathon has
since moved it to **16 September 2026, 23:00**, so read the urgency here as historical.
This path needs no infrastructure, and sponsored
deploys shipped in NIGHTGATE 0.21.0 on 25 August, so the deploy is ours to run rather than something
we wait on ODATANO to do for us. Agent grants never used to include deploys; grant `shieldvin-w1`
carries `allowDeploy: true`, `maxDeploys: 2`, 200 sponsored jobs per UTC day.

**The privacy model is untouched, and this is the reason the dependency is acceptable.** Every
transaction is built, proven and **signed locally**; NIGHTGATE receives transaction bytes with the
fee unpaid, pays, and submits. It never holds a witness. Calls into our contract *cannot* run on
their server — `recordField` and `proveField*` need witnesses the server has no material for.
[D13](#settled) holds: no end user touches a wallet, and deployment is a one-off admin act.

**Fallback, at the cost of one step:** because the transaction is signed before it leaves us, a
sponsor outage is survivable by submitting it ourselves from a funded wallet. That is a change to
the final step, not a rebuild — which is what makes the dependency on `api.nightgate.dev`
tolerable after the 503 incident on 25 August.

**Attribution consequence.** Wave 1 genuinely builds on ODATANO in three ways: the field panel's
derivation (`dpp-sdk`), local transaction building (`nightgate-tx`), and sponsored fees. The README
states all three, including that NIGHTGATE pays and submits but never sees a witness. Under-claiming
this would fail `w1-audit-fork`, which exists to state the relationship before a judge finds it.
What we must *not* claim is NIGHTGATE's CAP service, OData layer, `attestation-vault` contract, or
disclosure grants — none of which are in this submission.

**Watch:** `maxDeploys: 2` means one redeploy in reserve, and `registerPassport` is insert-once per
`vinHash`, so a redeploy starts from an empty ledger. Do not spend a deploy on a contract that is
not final.

### D21 — A dependency-free app server makes the frontend functional · 2026-08-27

`npm run app` starts one Node server (no packages beyond Node itself) that serves the three
surfaces — verification, intake console, proof explorer — and runs the compiled circuits
in-process. Submitting the console form registers, records and proves for real; refusals are
returned and rendered, not hidden. Served statically (GitHub Pages), the same pages fall back to
the committed demo export, and the console produces an intake file instead — each mode labels
itself.

**Why:** "fill in the fields and see the proofs" must actually work for anyone who clones the
repo, and the alternatives failed that test. Running `compact-runtime` in the browser needs a
bundler (against D11's no-build-step rule and unproven under deadline); a file-download-and-run-a-
script flow is not a frontend. One in-process server is the smallest thing that is honestly
functional — and it mirrors the real architecture, where an operator's backend runs proving and
buyers verify statically.

**The boundary that matters:** values submitted through the console exist only inside the server
process, exactly as they would inside a wallet. What `/api/ledger` exports is commitments and
claims — the same shape the chain would show, produced by the same export code as the committed
demo state (`scripts/lib/scenario.mjs`, shared so the two cannot drift).

### D22 — The project is VINPassport; ShieldVIN is retired · 2026-08-27

The name ShieldVIN collided with an existing registered company, found before any
mainnet deploy and before the Wave 1 submission. The project, the GitHub organisation
(`VINPassport`), the repository (`VINPassport/VINPassport`), the npm scope
(`@vinpassport/passport`), and the contract (`contracts/vinpassport`) are all renamed.

Because nothing had been deployed to preprod, the rename reached the protocol layer at
zero cost: every domain-separation tag moved from `shieldvin:*` to `vinpassport:*`
(`vinpassport:field:v1`, `vinpassport:claim:atmost:v1`, `vinpassport:claim:atleast:v1`,
`vinpassport:leaf:v0`, `vinpassport:leafsalt:v0`), which changes the circuits and
therefore the eventual contract address. (The address itself is minted fresh with
each built deploy transaction; only the one that is submitted fixes it, and it is
recorded in `deploy/preprod.json` at that moment.) After a deploy this would have meant a second
grant slot and a migration; on 2026-08-27 it meant a recompile and a green test run.

One identifier deliberately keeps the old name: ODATANO's agent grant is `shieldvin-w1`.
That string is their record key, not our brand, and renaming it is not ours to do.

### D23 — Wave 1 contract limits, stated rather than hidden · 2026-08-30

An adversarial security review of the deployed contract confirmed the commitment-opening pattern,
the ledger-pinned integrity rules and the domain separation are all correct. It also surfaced four
properties of the Wave 1 contract that we record here plainly, because a limitation a judge can
disprove costs more than one we name ourselves. The contract is deployed and immutable, so these are
disclosures for Wave 1 and fixes for Wave 2, not pre-submission patches.

1. **No access control on `registerPassport` or `initialiseField`.** Both are insert-once and
   neither checks the caller. Because `vinHash = blake2b(VIN)` is publicly derivable, any party can
   pre-register a VIN (fixing its `registrarId` and `contentRoot`) or seize a still-uninitialised
   field of a registered passport (fixing its value, salt and monotonicity rule) — permanently, with
   no recovery circuit. This is a *liveness and integrity* gap, distinct from the already-documented
   *attribution* gap that the registrar string is unauthenticated. Wave 2 gates both circuits on a
   registrar identity derived in-circuit from a witness secret and compared to pinned ledger state
   (never `ownPublicKey()`).

2. **The VIN namespace is first-come and unrecoverable in Wave 1.** A corollary of (1): the first
   registration of a VIN is also the only one, forever. `BATCH-INTAKE.md` presents insert-once as a
   safety property, which it is — but the namespace has no allowlist yet, so first-come is also
   first-and-only. Wave 2: an allowlist of registrar identities pinned at deploy.

3. **Field commitments are not bound in-circuit to the anchored `contentRoot`.** No circuit reads
   the `contentRoot` value; proofs bind a value to its `fieldCommitment`, not to the anchored
   document. `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s trust-gap section now states this precisely. Wave 2 anchors field
   commitments as leaves of the same root, or proves inclusion.

4. **`vinHash` is public and its per-slot updates are an observable side channel.** `vinHash` is a
   cleartext key on the ledger and `slotOf(vinHash, fieldKey)` is reproducible off-chain from
   published constants, so an observer holding a VIN can enumerate its slots and see *which* field
   changed on each `recordField` — an event disclosure without a value disclosure. Since a same-value
   rewrite is permitted, scheduled cover-traffic rewrites decorrelate a write from an event; this is
   noted for Wave 2, not implemented in Wave 1. This corrects the earlier assumption (old D19 phrasing
   and a test comment) that an observer does not know the VIN — the interested party always does.

The demo-data generator's salts are a separate, off-contract item tracked in the open-issues list.

### D24 — We pay our own fees; the sponsor path is retired · 2026-08-31

The live demo funds its own transactions. Fees are balanced from DUST held in a VINPassport wallet
and submitted straight to the public preprod node with `author_submitExtrinsic`. ODATANO's hosted
NIGHTGATE is no longer in the runtime path at all: no token, no sponsor session, no
`api.nightgate.dev` call. [D20](#settled) is **amended, not reversed** — its library half stands.

**Why:** two reasons. The 503 on 25 August showed that a demo a judge runs on their own time cannot
have a hosted single point of failure in its critical path. And DUST turns out to be self-renewing:
it regenerates from NIGHT that is *registered for dust generation*, so a funded wallet refills
itself between runs rather than needing a faucet or a sponsor. Nine registered UTxOs currently
carry enough DUST for roughly two thousand runs against a self-imposed cap of five per day.

**This is the fallback D20 wrote down in advance**, not an improvisation: *"because the transaction
is signed before it leaves us, a sponsor outage is survivable by submitting it ourselves from a
funded wallet. That is a change to the final step, not a rebuild."* It cost one function.

**What still comes from ODATANO, and must keep being said:** the field panel's derivation
(`@odatano/dpp-sdk`), and local transaction building plus batch segment ordering
(`@odatano/nightgate-tx`) — both on every single run. The **contract deployment on 28 August was
genuinely sponsored** under grant `shieldvin-w1`, and that stays in the attribution permanently.
What we must no longer claim is ongoing fee sponsoring: [D20](#settled)'s attribution paragraph was
written when that was true and is now an *over*-claim of a partner's involvement, which is worse
than an under-claim. README, org profile and ARCHITECTURE.md corrected the same day.

**Unchanged:** the privacy boundary. Every transaction was already built, proven and signed locally;
NIGHTGATE never saw a witness when it paid, and there is no witness to see now. [D13](#settled)
holds too — no end user touches a wallet; this is our treasury paying, which is exactly the model.

**Where NIGHTGATE returns:** disclosure grants in Phase 1. Self-funding fees was a resilience
decision for one demo, not a direction of travel.

## Reversed

Recorded so they are not accidentally reinstated.

### R1 — Ed25519 for sensor signatures · REVERSED 2026-08-21
Previously "Ed25519 is correct for SE chips." **No longer safe.**

Compact has no Ed25519 verification in any version — confirmed at source across six release tags.
Nor is there any in-circuit signature verification at all on mainnet (0.31.x / ledger 8).
`jubjubSchnorrVerify` exists only on the ledger-9 RC line, undocumented and publicly deployed
nowhere. This now stands as a constraint on Compact itself rather than a note about a future phase:
[R5](#reversed) removed the hardware work, so there is no signature spec left to write.

### R2 — Seven-portal architecture · REVERSED 2026-08-21
Superseded by D8.

### R3 — OEM-first go-to-market · REVERSED 2026-06-04
Superseded by D7.

### R4 — Patent as IP moat · REVERSED 2026-08-21
Superseded by D4.

### R5 — Hardware as Phase 2 · REVERSED 2026-09-09
Previously the hardware half of [D6](#settled): *"The chips return in Phase 2 to close the trust
gap."* On-device chip proving is **out of scope with no timeline** — not a phase, not a milestone,
and it must not appear as one in the roadmap, the deck, the README, or a conversation.

**Why:** it scheduled work the project has never scoped, sized or costed, and a dated phase reads as
a commitment. Nothing about the hardware was ever wrong; what was wrong was putting a number on it.

**What replaces it:** the trust gap closes at the **writer**, not the sensor. A value committed by a
party already accountable for it — a registry, a tester, an insurer, writing under an accountable
identity — with marking that lets a verifier tell such a write from a self-declared one. That is a
data-relationship problem before it is a cryptographic one. See the trust-gap section and the scope
notice in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

**Not reversed:** chip-free with no hardware root of trust, which is now the whole of
[D6](#settled). Sensor attestation stays true as a statement about what *would* also close the gap;
it is not a plan, and it does not get a date.

**Consequence:** the Phase 2 section of [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) is rewritten rather than deferred.
Its simulated secure element, curve-agile signature spec and ledger-9 in-circuit verification design
are removed outright.

### R6 — Independent dealers as the beachhead · REVERSED 2026-09-08
Previously [D7](#settled), taken 2026-06-04 on external ICP review. Superseded by the four-stage
regulatory cascade: **manufacturers first**, then manufacturer dealerships, then the second-hand
trade, then vehicle users.

**Why:** D7's own reasoning was that 2026/1738 pushes ELV and circularity data through dealers
"well before the 2032 passport deadline". That is still true, but it is not the *first* binding
date, and the first binding date lands on someone else. Euro 7
([Regulation (EU) 2024/1257](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1257/oj)) requires an
Environmental Vehicle Passport with every new M1/N1 type from **29 November 2026**, and that
obligation is the manufacturer's. The party facing the earliest deadline leads.

**Citation status, and it is not clean.** The regulation and the date are recorded here; the
*article* within Euro 7 is not, because it has never been read against the Official Journal text the
way every 2026/1738 citation now has been. This project has twice shipped a wrong article number,
both times plausible, both times caught only by reading the primary source — see the *"Not the
passport"* warning in [REGULATION.md](REGULATION.md). Euro 7 has **no entry in REGULATION.md at
all**, which by this project's own rule makes the cascade's founding date an open question rather
than a settled citation. Closing that is the next regulatory task, and it is a real gap in this
reversal, not a formality.

**Relationship to [R3](#reversed):** R3 reversed OEM-first *in favour of* D7, so this partially
reinstates a direction R3 rejected. That is not a circle, and the difference matters. R3's objection
was that OEMs are hard to reach, slow, and not the party feeling the pain — all true of a
product-led pitch. Regulation supplies what was missing: a dated obligation a manufacturer cannot
decline. This is regulation-led, and it does not reinstate the OEM *pitch* R3 threw out.

**Dealers are not abandoned.** They move from stage one to stage two and three of the cascade, and
D7's reasoning about their liability and reachability holds there unchanged.

### Resolved

**Q1 — "Will ODATANO consider Merkle depth 5 (32 slots)?" — YES, shipped 2026-08-22.**
NIGHTGATE 0.19.0 introduced `attestation-vault-32`, and `@odatano/dpp-sdk@0.2.0` exposes
`VAULT_SLOT_WIDTHS = [8, 16, 32]`. Asked on the 21st, answered by a release on the 22nd — not on our
account. See [D15](#settled).

**Q2 — "Does a custom panel need an `attestation-vault` change?" — reframed, not needed.**
A registered contract now carries a `slotWidth` and the surface sizes itself from it. We select a
lineage by name (`compiledArtifactRef: 'attestation-vault-32'`) rather than modifying a contract.
