/**
 * The preprod demo engine: runs a REAL intake against the DEPLOYED vinpassport
 * contract on Midnight preprod, self-funded from our own wallet.
 *
 * This is the productized form of the two proven spikes (spike-call-build +
 * fund-and-submit): per run it plans the intake into batched contract calls,
 * pre-simulates them locally so in-circuit refusals are caught and REPORTED
 * rather than submitted, proves each batch in-process (wasm), pays the dust
 * fee with the wallet this process holds, submits over one-shot WebSocket
 * JSON-RPC (the HTTP gateway 403s bodies over ~14KB), and watches the indexer
 * until the call is on chain. The caller gets a receipt file holding the
 * values and salts - the private half of the passport - which never leave
 * this process any other way.
 *
 * preprod-plan.mjs holds the two rules this engine cannot get wrong: how calls
 * pack into transactions, and why per-call witness state must be armed.
 *
 * Demo policy (locked design): a GLOBAL cap of runs per UTC day, guided and
 * manual counted together; every run uses a fresh random VPD-prefixed VIN so
 * demos never collide with each other or with real vehicles.
 *
 * Requires (never committed, never sent to the client):
 *   VINPASSPORT_SEED_FILE   file containing VINPASSPORT_SEED_HEX=<128 hex>
 *   VINPASSPORT_STATE_DIR   dir with {shielded,unshielded,dust}.blob snapshots
 *   VINPASSPORT_DEMO_CAP    optional, default 5
